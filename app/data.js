export const Bio = `  Hello! Iâ€™m Jesse, and I find joy in crafting digital experiences
            that thrive on the web. My journey into web development began in
            2017 when my fascination with gadgets ignited a passion for the
            underlying technologies. As a creative developer, I specialize in
            leveraging modern tools and frameworks like React.js and Next.js to
            bring ideas to life. With a solid foundation in Node.js and Express.js, I embrace the challenge of building scalable full-stack web applications.`;
